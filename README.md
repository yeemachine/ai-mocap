## Course Description:
This course introduces the basics of MediaPipe, a framework for building machine learning pipelines for processing time-series data like video[^1^][4]. You will learn how to use MediaPipe to create real-time video effects using face, hand, and pose detection[^2^][3]. You will also learn how to use web technologies like TensorFlow.js and WebGL to run and render your effects in the browser. By the end of this course, you will be able to create your own web experience that leverages MediaPipe and other tools for interactive and creative applications.

## Prerequisites:
- Basic web development knowledge (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Familiarity with machine learning concepts (optional)

## Course Objectives:
- Understand the principles and components of MediaPipe
- Use MediaPipe Face Mesh, Hand Tracking, and Pose Tracking solutions
- Apply video effects using OpenGL ES and GPU calculators[^3^][1]
- Integrate MediaPipe with TensorFlow.js and WebGL
- Design and implement a web-based video effect project

## Required Resources:
- A computer with a webcam and a microphone
- A web browser that supports WebGL (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- A code editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)
- A GitHub account

## Attendance Policy:
- Attendance is mandatory for all sessions
- Absences must be excused in advance by email
- More than two unexcused absences will result in a 10% deduction from the final grade
- Tardiness of more than 15 minutes will count as an absence

## Grading Policy:
- Assignments: 40%
- Quizzes: 20%
- Final Project: 30%
- Participation: 10%
